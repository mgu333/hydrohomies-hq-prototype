Screenshots and GIF placeholders

Place any screenshots (mobile.png, desktop.png) and a short GIF (demo.gif) here. I couldn't capture GUI screenshots in this headless session; run the game locally and add images.

To publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Commit and push to `main`.
2. In your repository Settings -> Pages, set Source to `main` branch and folder `/ (root)` or `/docs` if you prefer.
3. Wait a minute and the site will be available at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`.
